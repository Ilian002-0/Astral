/*
  This file is intentionally left blank.
  The original TailwindCSS directives (@tailwind, @apply) require a build step
  that is not available in this environment.

  To fix this, styling is now handled by:
  1. The Tailwind Play CDN script, included in `index.html`.
  2. A `<style>` tag in `index.html` for custom animations and utility classes.
